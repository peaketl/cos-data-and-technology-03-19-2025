# Set environment variables
# PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE is an environment variable in Python that prevents the interpreter 
# from writing .pyc files (bytecode files) to disk. When set to a non-empty string, Python will not generate 
# these files upon importing modules. This can be useful in environments where writing files is undesirable, such 
# as in certain deployment scenarios or when working with read-only file systems.
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

# The PYTHONUNBUFFERED environment variable in Python controls the buffering behavior of standard 
# output and standard error streams. When set to a non-empty string (e.g., "1" or "TRUE"), it forces these streams 
# to be unbuffered. This means that output written to them is immediately flushed and appears directly, without waiting 
# for a buffer to fill up.
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
