# NOTE:  The database container is not setup for persistent storage.  This is a simple demo application and the data will be
# lost when the container is stopped.  In a production environment, you would want to use a volume to store the data on the host machine.

# Use the official PostgreSQL image
FROM postgres:latest

# Copy any custom SQL scripts to initialize the database (if needed)
# COPY ./init.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
