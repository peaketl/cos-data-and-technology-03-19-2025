# NOTE:  The database container is not setup for persistent storage.  This is a simple demo application and the data will be
# lost when the container is stopped.  In a production environment, you would want to use a volume to store the data on the host machine.

# Use the official PostgreSQL image

# Use a smaller image for production
FROM postgres:17.4-alpine3.21

# Copy any custom SQL scripts to initialize the database (if needed)
